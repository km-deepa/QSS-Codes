# QSS-Codes
We have developed a "Quantum secret sharing protocol in the presence of noisy channels with application in visual cryptography".
We have analyzed the impact of two specific noisy environments, namely the Amplitude Damping Noisy Environment and the Phase Damping Noisy Environment.
The proposed scheme has been simulated using the IBM-Quantum Experience cloud platform.
We are providing the codes for the simulation of the QSS scheme as well as the MATLAB code for generating the fidelity graphs.

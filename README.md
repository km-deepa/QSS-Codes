# QSS-Codes
We have put forth a "Quantum secret sharing protocol utilizing a noisy channel with an application in visual cryptography." Our analysis focuses on the impact of two types of noisy environments: Amplitude Damping Noisy Environment and Phase Damping Noisy Environment. To evaluate our proposal, we conducted simulations on the IBM-Quantum Experience cloud platforms. Additionally, we are providing the code for the 'simulation of the Quantum Secret Sharing (QSS) scheme' as well as the 'Fidelity graphs obtained using MATLAB.

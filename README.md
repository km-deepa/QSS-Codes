# QSS-Codes
we proposed a  "Quantum secret sharing protocol through noisy channel wit application in visual cryptography"
We analyse the effect of two nosy enviroments such as Amplitude Damping Noisy Environment and Phase Damping Noisy Environment.
We simulate the proposed scheme on IBM-quantum experience cloud platforms.
We are sharing the codes of 'simulation of QSS scheme' and 'Fidelity graphs determined on MATLAB'.
